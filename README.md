# Greasemonkey scripts

A collection of scripts used to fix random things I find annoying, and add 
features I want to other peoples' sites.

* Linguee_Frequency - Adds basic word frequency statistics against each German 
word in the Linguee English<->German dictionary
* h264ify - Forces YouTube to use h264 instead of VP9
* Google_Analytics_Mock - Creates a mock of Google Analytics (and several other 
trackers) so that websites won't break if when AdBlock blocks trackers. Works
by replacing global variables with a JavaScript Proxy that pretends to be 
everything.
